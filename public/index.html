        <p>It is 2101, the year of our lord Jesus Christ, who died for our sins. You are a undercover mouse trained by <strong>MOUSE MILITIA</strong> to kill 34th president Abraham Clinton in the opal office. He hath done'st a very bad thing by opening up a wormhole to the planet Sector 8, where aliens plan to legalise marajuana! Stop those evil aliens and their early colludites, and ride up to claim the land that was once ours one hundred million years ago. Peace to all of the friends who shelter here, and divest us from you dark truths Oh Patan.</p>
